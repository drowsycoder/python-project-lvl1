The game set is based on a single engine module and includes 5 game modules:

1. Calc game: Calculate the result of a simple arithmetic expression.
2. Even game: Determine is a given number even or not.
3. GCD game: Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
4. Prime game: Determine is a given number prime or not.
5. Progression game: Find the missing element in an arithmetic progression.
